"""Build a planner_agent plan.json: execute each feasible task in dependency order,
verify deterministically, and report. Local-only (opencode + Gemma + code), no Claude.

A task's outcome is one of:
  - built   : deliverable produced, parses, no stub fingerprints (acceptance met)
  - failed  : deliverable produced but doesn't parse or is a stub (quality issue)
  - no_output: opencode produced nothing after retries (builder flakiness)
Prerequisites build before dependents (shared workspace) so a dependent can use them.
